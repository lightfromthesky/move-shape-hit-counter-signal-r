# moveShape-hitCounter-signalR
Simple Application demonstarting SignalR.

This app contains two html files, 

1) HitCounter.html
   Keeps track of the number of clients/browser tabs that are connected on the web page.
   
2) MoveShape.html 
   Enables a user/client to move a shape on the web page and the same movement is reflected on the other clients (in their web page) connected at that point of time, just like in video games with multiplayer capability. Go ahead and try it! :)
